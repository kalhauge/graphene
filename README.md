Graphene
========

A multimedia layer for making games and mulitmedia appliactions using Python.
The special fokus of this engine is to expand the opengl layer so that it
becomes esier to work with, and pythonic.

The project strives to create a logical calling method and layer that en able
people to use opengl with ease from a python program. The library should not 
do what opengl does, but what it ment. 

OpenGL is build as a large state machine. This makes aplications fast to run 
as state is not mentioned in all calls.
